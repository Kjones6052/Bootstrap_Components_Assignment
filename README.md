# **Hello, World**

This repository contains files that were used to create a web page for my Bootstrap Components Assignment, Module 9 Lesson 4.

Overview:

This assignment builds on a previously designed web page for the ficticious company 'Tech Solutions'. With the web page designed prior to this 
assignment I've added a responsive Navigation Bar, elements displaying information using Bootstrap's card classes, and interactive buttons to the 
web page design.

Tasks Completed:

Task 1: This was completed by implementing a responsive Nav Bar. This web page did not already include a Nav Bar so one was made for this 
assignment.

Task 2: This was completed by changing the Services Offered section to utilize Bootstrap Card classes. This changed the presentation of the 
information in this section to be displayed as info cards with a photo in the top half, and in the bottom half a title and description of the 
service.

Task 3: This was completed by adding a section into the 'styles.css' file to make a hover effect for the button used in the 'Contact Us' section.
